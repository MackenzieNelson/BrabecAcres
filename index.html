      <div class="aboutUs">
        <p>We are a small Wisconsin farm specializing in minature Myatonic goats, commonly called fainting goats. The breed has a harmless condition called myotonia congenital that causes the muscles to stiffen when they&apos;re startled or excited, causing them to lock-up or &quot;faint&quot;. This is a rare breed with only aroud ten thousand world-wide. They are parasite resistant, gentle and easy to care for. Due to their condition they, unlike other breeds of goat, do not jump on things, climb fences, and rarely attempt to escape thier pen. They make wonderful pets and are great around children. Our herd is clean tested for Jophne&apos;s, CAE and CL. All of our goats are registered with the Myotonic Goat Registry and we are proud to be members of this registry.</p>
