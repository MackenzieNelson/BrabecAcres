      <h3>Terms of Sale</h3>
       <div class="terms">
        <p>All prices are determined on each goat individually based on the color, moonspotted, confirmation, eye color, polled or horned, etc. Price will be set on each kid determinint those factors.</p>
        <p>We do not sell bottle kids, our kids are weaned between 8 and nine weeks of age. We disbud all of our horned kids, however we do not guarentee no scurs.</p>
        <p>We name the kids at birth, when you pick our your goat you can choose a new name, or keep it's current name. We register our Bucks and Does with the Myotonic Goat Registry and provide customers with a folder containing MGR registration transfer papers. Wethers will not be registered but we will have registration applications for the buyer to register themselves.</p>
        <p>We require 1/2 down payment to hold your kid or kids until pick up date, in either cash or check. At pick up we accept cash only.</p>
        <p>We do not ship or meet half-way, you must pick up in person. No goats will leave our farm until paid in full.</p>
        <p>We do not sell goats for meat. We do not sell one goat to a home without other goats. They need companion goats being that they are herd animals.</p>
        <p>If the seller need to cancle a sale for any reason, we reserve that right, but will return the full down payment.</p>
        <p>Our goats will be up to date on all vaccinatiolns and deworming, as well as hoof trimming. They will be disbudded, however we do not guarentee the results. Bucklings bought as wethers will be banded before leaving our farm. If you do not your kid disbudded, you must request so after deposit.</p>
        <p>Being we register our goats with MGR sometimes the registration papers do not arrive by the pick up date for the goat. If this happens, we will send the pedigree ands appropriate transfer papers to you as soon as possible. All wethers must be and will be required to be registered under the Brabec Acres name.</p>
        <p>Once you have signed the purchase agreement and thae animal has left our farm, we are no longer responsible for that animal.</p>
